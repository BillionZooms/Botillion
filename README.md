# Botillion

A bot meant for me to practice using discord.py and other packages such as json, logging, etc.

# Features
## 8Ball

The 8ball command is just a simple command which pulls possible answers from a text file and using the random package to choose a random answer for you.
Formatted in Embed to look better :)

## Create room

The create room command is used to create a voice channel with the user(s) you've mentioned. The room can have up to as many as you want users and only you and the users you provide will be able to see that voice channel.
You can clear all the private voice channels that you've made using the clear room command. Everything is saved in a .json file so restarting/crashing is not a problem.

## Blacklist

Currently doesn't do anything except add a user's ID and name into a text file. Command in the future is going to be a simple blacklist command to blacklist specific users from using any commands from the bot. blacklist_list shows you the users that have been blacklisted. 

## Stats
Make a stats category channel and add stats you wish. Stats get updated every second/minute/hour using @tasks.loop()

# What to expect

Well, there's not much to expect from this project as it's meant for me to practice discord.py but the bot will be as organized as possible and will be full open-source. 
There's many more features to come and hopefully this bot will be a good foundation for me to start making actual useful bots.
